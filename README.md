# SpotifyPlayer
Spotify player built utilizing a Raspberry Pi... Employs a Python script that calls the Spotify API to pull songs that are requested via a microphone input

## Initially a group project
Want to extend upon this, possibly make it a discord bot and deploy it so my friends and I can listen to some music on discord. Unfortunately, too many bots that we use these days are getting removed, so I am hoping this will be a great alternative!
